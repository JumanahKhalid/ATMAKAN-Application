## 1. Problem Statement & Significance
Technology effects almost every aspect in our everyday lives. It offers a variety of facilities in various sectors and pervades several areas such as transportation, education, agriculture, etc. In particular, mobile technology has witnessed correlated evolution. It has become not only an inevitable mean of communication but also an inescapable tool exploitable in wide range of areas. More specifically, the use of technology in the medical field has leaped to the fore in the last few years. It enables, for instance, the early and accurate diagnosis of health problems, facilitating timely intervention and communication between the patients and medical staff. One may take advantage of this technology in one sensitive area where the patient is a child suffering from autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The ASD is a development impairment brought about by brain differences. It is a word used to characterize a collection of repetitive sensory and motor activities, early onset social communication difficulties, and a significant hereditary component. Previous research studies indicate that between 50% and 80% of autism risk is genetic and boys are born with autism spectrum disorder four times more than girls. According to WHO, around one in 100 children worldwide suffer from autism.
## 2. Proposed Solution (System)
In this project, we propose ATMAKAN mobile application that supports children with ASD disorder. It will allow children to improve their emotional, educational and interactive skills through well-defined exercises that matches the Autism level of the child which can be deduced after performing a test through the application. More specifically, it will enable the parent to see the feedback of his kid by accessing to the historical record. In addition, it will provide a communication service that allows the parent to contact a therapist and listen to his advice and suggestions. Other key features offered by the program include sign up, donations, and the creation of statistics reports. In conclusion, the major objective is to create a mobile application with a user-friendly interface for kids with ASD that practically satisfies the needs of both parents and their kids.

## 3. Project Domain & Limitation
 The proposed mobile application will target kids with an autism spectrum disorder. It will help them to improve their behavioral, communication and social skills. It also will provide support to parents by allowing them to instantly contact therapists and follow up the medical situations of their kids. In this project will consider only kids who their age is from 4 years to 12 years and suffer from mid, average and server levels of ASD. It will be provided only for Android software platform.
